This is a 4-level risk management tool existing within my portfolio. I developed it solely to eradicate a lot of risk that my funds are exposed to, as these markets are highly volatile and can cause significant financial loss. The funds that are traded are labelled Cushion value and make just 30% of the entire funds, meaning, a back-to-back loss would result to just 30%, and 70 % still intact.
Each asset class is also allocated an amount with consideration of level of volatility, for instance, metals and indices are very volatile as compared to forex and energies, and so receive a greater allocation of funds. Each asset also has its own allocation which determines the position sizing during execution of trades, volatility, swaps and commissions are also considered during allocation.
 
The drawdown allocation covers for swaps, commissions, spreads and losses incurred as a result of slippage in the market. 
Please note that this is a model portfolio and risk management tool meaning the funds in $ are arbitrary and that any value can be altered in the Floor Value and Cushion value  as well as  Percentages and all other values in the cells throughout the sheet will adjust automatically, thus possessing adaptability and dynamism attributes of an ideal risk management.





 	SUMMARY TRACK RECORD.
This part of the entire system enables for easy journaling of trades so as to calculate win rate, Sharpe ratio and other ratios as well. The information contained in this sheet can be used to get just but a glance on the health of the trading system over a certain period of time and apply changes if the ratios direct so.
 
The LINK TO TRADE column enables for obtaining more information in either video or pictorial format of the trade. 
Just to say the least, journaling is the Holy Grail every inexperienced trader is in quest for.













 	FUNDAMENTAL DASHBOARD.
Macros make up an important part of the whole trading industry. I always consider data of any kind released by parent countries of the assets in my portfolio. To be specific, I mostly trade U.S Dollar dominated markets(any tied/pegged to the dollar) due to volatility and ease of access of verified information.
 
This system harbors data of the key indicators of the prevailing state of the economy, either inflation, deflation or benign. The separate scorecard used with this system tells whether execute a trade, exit a trade, or hold on to existing position; thus, a whole in one tool, I just have to pay attention to data releases and update the data accordingly.

Post script:
However much I may trust  my system and standard operating procedures, it does not mean that it  is wholly bullet proof. A minute discrepancy or transpositional error could cause significant changes thus resulting in action over false information and consequently leading to losses. It is very important  for me to do objective research and verify the data religiously to avoid chaos and making uninformed decisions which directly lead to undesired trading results.
